## Introduction ##

FileGuard is a Monitoring System for Confidential Files based on Windows File Filter Drivers.

To defend from four possible threats, we design and implement this monitoring system, which has a complete prevention architecture, including application layer and kernel layer. It has the following main features:

  1. File redirection, which is similar to the "honeypot" technology.
  1. Hide our confidential files; Disable access and delete our confidential files.
  1. Able to monitor processes; Restore the disk volume; Transparent encryption and decryption.
